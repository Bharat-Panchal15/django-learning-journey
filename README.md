# Django Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my step-by-step learning of Django.  
I’m following a **phase-based roadmap**, where each phase is a fresh Django project with its own environment.  
The goal is to internalize Django fundamentals and gradually build production-ready skills.

🎯 Goal

Build a solid Django foundation by completing each phase and documenting the journey.
At the end, the plan is to create real-world projects that cover CRUD, authentication, APIs, and deployment.
